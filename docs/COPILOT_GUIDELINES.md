## Critical Development Rules
- **Phase 0 First**: NEVER proceed beyond Phase 0 without explicit approval from Ron Lederer
- Phase 0 must deliver a complete design showcase for approval before any core features
- Always follow the PRD and architecture docs in /docs
- Use Material UI + Framer Motion for UI/UX
- Use Firebase for auth, storage, and analytics
- Use i18next for internationalization
- Write clean, documented, and testable code
- **Maintain 80%+ test coverage at all times**
- **Write tests alongside or before implementation**
- **All features must pass E2E tests before merge**
- Use ports 3200 and above
- Keep root directory clean and organized
- Always check for Windows compatibility
- Prioritize security, GDPR, and scalability
- Suggest AI-powered features where relevant
- Never start coding before updating docs and structure
- Communicate clearly with Ron Lederer

## Phase 0 Requirements
