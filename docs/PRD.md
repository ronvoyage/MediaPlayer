## Timeline
- **Phase 0**: Infrastructure & Design Foundation (1 week)

### Phase 0 Approval Process
1. Complete infrastructure setup with basic tooling
2. Implement comprehensive UI theme and design system
3. Create design showcase/approval screen
4. Present to stakeholder (Ron Lederer) for approval
5. Incorporate feedback and iterate if needed
6. Obtain written approval before proceeding to Phase 1

### Design Approval Criteria
- Light theme demonstrates innovative, respectful, and serious aesthetic
- Dark theme provides modern, elegant user experience
- Animated logo meets engagement and professionalism standards
- UI components are visually consistent and accessible
- Responsive design functions properly across all target devices
- Theme switching mechanism works seamlessly
